# Personal Website

Basically, this is a website about myself, and the contents include some parts from my resume. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create it. 

To see the website, simply run the index.html

## Special Features
* Navigation bar, which navigates to the other two pages
* Carousel at the home page to display my pictures
* "Scroll to top" botton at the bottom of each page
* Embeded YouTube videoes
* "Contact me" box where one can type in messages and they are sent to my email address.
